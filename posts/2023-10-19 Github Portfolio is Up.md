My site was broken, something on the server side was throwing a 404 status code, basically meaning "Page not found", so I could not even see my own website. I was devastated. My dreams of being the next Vitalik Buterin were crushed. I decided to fix it. After hours of debugging, I was finally able to see my site again, but then realized how ugly it was. It needed a lot of work to keep it updated.

I want to be cool like Vitalik Buterin. I want to have my own site to post my thoughts. But wait, I also want to showcase my projects. I want to introduce any web travelers that pass by my site to the things that I do. One important thing is that any good site needs RSS support and SEO optimization so Google can find it.

This sounds like a lot of maintenance work. I'll need to keep the RSS feed up to date and generate a new sitemap whenever I create a new post or project. I don't have time for that. I just want to show what I'm working on and update people once or twice a year. I'm not a professional writer, I write at a 10 year old's level. I don't need a whole CMS for this. And I definitely don't want to pay monthly for one. I just need to write blogs and update my projects without managing anything else. 

So I did what any lazy developer would do - let GitHub handle the hosting. I created [GitHub Portfolio](https://github.com/jorge-menjivar/GitHub-Portfolio), the perfect solution for me. No worrying about servers or CMS. It automatically fetches my GitHub activity for my portfolio. All I do is write markdown files for blog posts. It handles the rest - RSS, sitemap, SEO, etc. Now I can focus on projects while it manages my portfolio and blog. Best of all, it's free since it uses Vercel hosting. You may be reading this from GitHub Portfolio or an RSS feed, but either way, it's thanks to GitHub.

You can set up your own site with GitHub Portfolio in 1 minute or less. It's open source and easy to customize however you want. Use it, break it, fix it, improve it - go wild!

That's it. Just wanted to share.
